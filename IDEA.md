Technical Development
---------------------

### Tools and Languages Required

#### Software Development Tools:

-   Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, or similar for writing code.
-   Version Control System: Git for tracking changes and collaboration.
-   Programming Languages:
    -   Python: Due to its libraries for networking and security, Python is ideal for scripting and automation.
    -   JavaScript (with Node.js): For developing a dynamic and interactive web dashboard.
    -   Bash Scripting: For server-side scripting and automation on the Raspberry Pi.

#### Cybersecurity Tools:

-   Wazuh: An open-source security monitoring solution that performs log analysis, file integrity monitoring, configuration assessment, and intrusion detection.
-   OpenVAS: An open-source vulnerability scanner and manager that can detect security issues in systems and networks.
-   Nmap: A network scanner used to discover devices running on a network and analyze the services they are running.

### Hardware:

-   Raspberry Pi: The Raspberry Pi (models 3B+ or later) will serve as the hardware platform for running the cybersecurity tools.
-   SD Card: For the Raspberry Pi's operating system and storage of software.
-   Power Supply: To power the Raspberry Pi.
-   Network Equipment: Routers, switches, and cables for setting up a network environment.
-   Optional Accessories: Cases, cooling systems, and backup power supplies for hardware longevity.

### Development Process:

1.  Setting Up Raspberry Pi:

    -   Install a Raspberry Pi-compatible Linux distribution (like Raspberry Pi OS).
    -   Configure network settings to enable remote access and communication.
2.  Installing Security Tools:

    -   Wazuh agent installation on the Raspberry Pi for monitoring and alerting.
    -   OpenVAS for vulnerability scanning of the network.
    -   Nmap for mapping the network and discovering active devices and services.
3.  Developing the Dashboard:

    -   Use web technologies to create a frontend that displays data from Wazuh and OpenVAS.
    -   Backend development to process data and handle requests from the frontend.
4.  Integration:

    -   Integrate the dashboard with the Raspberry Pi, ensuring it can display real-time data.
    -   Automate the process of scanning and monitoring, and ensure alerts are sent to the dashboard.

### Cost for Production:

-   Hardware Costs: Raspberry Pi setups are relatively low-cost, and bulk purchasing can lead to discounts. Each unit (Raspberry Pi, SD card, power supply) can range from $50 to $100.
-   Software Development: Mainly human resource costs, which can vary based on the complexity of the solution and the developers' expertise.
-   Testing and Quality Assurance: Additional costs for thorough testing of the software and hardware.

### Pricing for SMBs and MSPs:

-   For SMBs: Small businesses are typically cost-sensitive and would prefer a one-time purchase or a low-cost subscription. Prices might range from $100 to $500 for a basic setup and subscription fees of $10 to $50 per month.
-   For MSPs: MSPs may prefer a tiered pricing model based on usage and the number of clients serviced. They might be willing to pay more for comprehensive features and scalability, with prices ranging from $500 to several thousand dollars, and monthly fees from $50 to $200 or more.

Pricing should consider production costs, market rates, perceived value, and competitive pricing. Offering a basic free version can also attract users who may convert to a paid plan.
